# Tire-Tag-Parking-Enforcement-System
In parking enforcement there is a fine line between immobilizing a vehicle, and creating a strong deterrent. The Tire Tag was designed based on the criteria that the driver should be able to move the vehicle in an emergency, but not want to move it otherwise.

## Theory and Design
There are many parking enforcement devices, from the traditional parking boot to modern solutions like the Barnacle. However, it is necessary to develop a parking enforcement system that satisfies all of the following:
* Emergency Mobility and Incentive: The Tire Tag locks to the rim of a vehicle, but doesn't prevent the tire from turning. The driver is deterred from moving because the added weight imbalances the tire causing excessive vibration when in motion.
* Compact: The Tire Tag is less than 3 lbs, and is no different than a bike lock.
* Safety & Speed: Wrapping the chain around a tire rim, applying a notification sticker to a window, and reading the license plate are relatively quick processes, leaving little time for confrontation to occur.
* Non-confrontational Release: The sticker placed on the window points the user to a website, where they enter their license plate number, and pay their fee online. Once paid, the violator is sent a code to unlock the device, and then they place it in a drop-box (a deposit is collected for the device, and returned once the device is confirmed to have been returned).
